# Psychological Thinking Mastermind Architecture

## Philosophy: Chess Master Approach
- **Fewer Moves, Maximum Impact**: Each file serves multiple strategic purposes
- **Write Once, Use Everywhere**: Universal components and utilities
- **Strategic Positioning**: Every code decision has compound benefits
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Reduced attack vectors, faster loading

## Core Strategy

### 1. Single Source of Truth Files
- `core.js` - Universal utilities, state, and logic
- `styles.css` - Complete styling system with CSS variables
- `components.html` - Reusable component templates
- `config.json` - All configuration in one place

### 2. GitHub + Replit Integration
- GitHub: Source of truth for code repository
- Replit: Automation, CI/CD, and development environment
- Seamless sync between both platforms

### 3. Performance Psychology
- Psychological loading: Users perceive speed through strategic design
- Minimal HTTP requests
- Inline critical CSS
- Lazy loading non-critical elements

## Implementation Plan
1. Consolidate current Shop&Glow into mastermind architecture
2. Set up GitHub integration
3. Configure Replit automation
4. Optimize for psychological speed perception
